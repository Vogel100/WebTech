	<h1>Different Methods</h1>
	
	<p>There are multiple ways to attach an event handler to an element. Assume we have a button with the id <em>clickButton</em> that 
	should trigger the function <em>myFunction</em> when it is clicked.</p>
	
	<p>The first option we could use is to call it from the onclick attribute in the html code. This would look like this:</p>
	
	<pre><code>&lt;button id = “clickButton” onclick = “myFunction()”&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>The problem with this is that the code is in the html document with the other content. This makes it less organized and it
	is generally preferable to keep coding and content separated. That way you can easily find everything in one document. If you 
	want to change the code, you know that everything is stored in the JavaScript document, so you won’t need to make any changes 
	to the html. Furthermore, it might be difficult to find the one small bit of coding between all of the other html content.</p>

	<p>A second way to do it would be about the same as the first method, except done in JavaScript instead of html. This will
	make it a lot easier if you want to update the code, as explained before. The code would look like this:</p>
	
	<pre><code>document.getElementById(“clickButton”).onclick = myFunction;</code></pre>

	<p>The disadvantage of this is that if you try to add another function that should also be executed when clicking the button,
	it will override the first one. So if there’s a chance a second function will be added later on, it’s probably better to use 
	a different method.</p>
	
	<p>A third option is to use the addEventListener function. Unlike onclick, using this function multiple times will result in
	multiple functions being attached to the event instead of replacing the previous one. However, Internet Explorer 8 and earlier
	don’t support this function, and some people still use this browser. (src: https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0)
	For most features, you can probably ignore earlier browsers, but if it is absolutely necessary for <em>clickButton</em> to work in every
	browser, you will have to solve it. Luckily, you can just use attachEvent for these browsers, which is almost the same as 
	addEventListener. You’ll have to do some more typing, however. The code would look like this:</p>

	<p>Without IE8 support:</p>
	
	<pre><code>document.getElementById(“clickButton”).addEventListener(“click”, myFunction);</code></pre>

	<p>With IE8 support:</p>
	
	<pre><code>var btn = document.getElementById(“clickButton”);
	if (btn.addEventListener)
	    btn.addEventListener(“click”, myFunction”);
	else
	    btn.attachEvent(“onclick”, myFunction);</code></pre>

	<p>The problem with both this method and the previous one is that even without IE8 support it is a lot of typing for such a
	small thing. Aside from being more work, this also makes the code harder to read.</p>

	<p>Which brings us to the final option that will be discussed here, using jQuery. Code that is pretty long to write in 
	raw JavaScript are often a lot shorter in jQuery. This is no exception. It would look like this (assuming you use $ as short 
	for jQuery):</p>
	
	<pre><code>$(“#clickButton”).click(myFunction);</code></pre>
	
	<p>This method does the same thing as the addEventListener with IE 8 support option, but it’s a lot shorter to write, and
	easier to read.</p>
