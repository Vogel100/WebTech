		<p>When an event is detected, the event handlers are executed in two phases, the capture phase and the bubble phase. 
		During the capture phase, the top of the DOM tree is checked first and it goes down until the bottom node that was
		triggered is reached. During the bubble phase, it is checked from the bottom to the top. This way, you can control which
		event handlers should be executed first and which ones should be done later.  You can decide which phase they should be
		done in by using the third optional parameter in the <em>addEventListener</em> function. If you set this parameter to
		true, the event will be done in the capture phase, otherwise it will be done in the bubble phase. If you use a different
		method of attaching event handlers or you omit the third parameter, it will be executed in the bubble phase by default.
		This means that if you do not specify anything, the bottom node will be handled before its ancestors.</p>
