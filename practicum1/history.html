	<article>
		<p>Events were first supported when Netscape 2 was released (1995). There werenâ€™t many events, 
		but they were very powerful, and they became famous quickly (mouseover, mouseout).
		They could detect when a user would submit a form, and made form-validation possible.
		Interaction was born.</p>
		<p>Event handlers were set inline, as an HTML attribute:</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;a href="myLink.html" onclick="alert('Do you wish to leave this page?')"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>This way of event handling was the standard set by Netscape Navigator 2. All other browsers had 
		to use it, otherwise JavaScript would stop working.</p>
